# MEAN Authentication Application
A authentication application that is built with Mongodb, Express, Angular, Node, passport, passport-jwt, angular2-flash-messages, angular2-jwt, bootstrap css framework and some other technologies. This application is uploaded to `heroku` and is now working.

## Development 
Install the dependencies on the root path and also on the `auth-app` folder located from the root path for the angular application.

```npm install```

## Running the Application
For the API, open the root project of the application run it with your commandline and run the command. Run the node or the nodemon if you have it installed in your system. Open your browser and go to the `localhost:3000` and that is the URL of our API.

```node app``` or ```nodemon```

For the UI which is angular, go to the root project of the application and into the `auth-app` folder and open it with your commandline and run the command `ng serve` and the default URL of our Angular application is `localhost:4200`.

```ng serve```

That's it. You can extend this application or use it as a starting point if you are going to build a MEAN stack application.
